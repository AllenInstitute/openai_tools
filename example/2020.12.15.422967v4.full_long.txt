In the publication titled "A standardized behavior equally impacts cortex," the authors investigate the impact of motor activity on primary sensory areas, specifically the visual cortex, in mice. The study aims to understand how behavior signals are broadcast to different areas and layers of the visual cortex. To extract principles on the neuronal correlates, the authors investigate a non-visually relevant behavioral event, fidgets, which are stereotypical behavioral responses potentially part of a stressful state. The authors use a large survey of neuronal responses recorded with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the mouse visual cortex to quantify and compare the neuronal correlates of standardized behavior events across all layers and most areas of the mouse visual cortex. They find that neurons in three different cortical layers and four visual areas have homogenous post-fidget neural responses, and the fidget response profiles were stereotypical and equally distributed among four response types. The authors also investigate whether layers or visual areas were differentially modulated by fidgeting but find that post-fidget responses did not differ between layers or areas. Furthermore, the authors hypothesize that fidget neuronal responses would not affect visual responses and find that all four sub-types of fidget responsive cell were equally responsive to visual stimuli and their sensory tuning properties to drifting gratings were not significantly different. The authors conclude that fidgeting, a non-relevant behavior, equally impacts the cortex and that the distribution of neural response types is consistent across layers and areas. This publication provides foundational knowledge for modeling cortical computation and sheds light on the occurrence of fidgets in mice and their correlation to visual stimuli.
This paper presents a study on the impact of standardized behaviors on the cortex through the use of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6f for in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. The authors propose a complementary approach to uncovering the role of motor signals in primary sensory areas by focusing their analysis on a single standardized behavior event. They demonstrate that fidget rate is correlated with visual stimulus type but independent of a mouse driver-line or session number, and that neuronal fidget response types are distributed equally across visual cortical layers and areas. The study also includes a detailed description of the methods used, including the generation of triple transgenic mice and the surgical protocols for implanting head-implants and cortical windows. The authors discuss the implications of their findings, suggesting that standardized behavior equally impacts the cortex, and future research could test whether a visually conditioned behavioral event transitions from a broad modulation to be more specific to certain visual areas during learning. The paper also describes the methodology used in another study involving calcium imaging experiments on mice to investigate the effects of visual stimuli on cortical activity. The study involved presenting images, including natural movie clips, to mice in grayscale at various rates and frequencies, and behavioral monitoring was carried out during the experiments, with eye movements and animal posture recorded using cameras and custom IR imaging systems. The study utilized various threshold criteria to cluster neuronal activity and determine the significance of neural activity modulation post-fidget.
The paragraph provides a detailed account of a study on the neural responses of mice during fidgeting behavior, and the importance of standardized behavior in the study of cortical activity. The study involved tracking the movement of the mouse's eye and running disk and analyzing the resulting data using various algorithms and methods. The F1-scores were calculated for each class to measure the accuracy of the classification, and statistical tests were performed, and corrections were made using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate framework. The study investigated the interaction between fidget and running modulation and used UMAP and Random Forest Classification to search for any differences between fidget neural responses across different cortical layers and visual areas. The results of the study provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying fidgeting behavior in mice and may have implications for understanding similar behavior in humans.
