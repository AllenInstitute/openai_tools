The paragraph describes a study that explores the hypothesis that the neocortex learns the structure of the environment in a predictive, hierarchical manner. The study aims to identify the observable signatures of this type of hierarchical predictive learning, in which learning is guided by unexpected sensory events. The authors used two types of visual stimuli, Gabor frames and visual flow stimuli, to monitor changes in the responses of visual cortical neurons in mice while they learned about new external stimuli. The responses of neurons in each region of interest (ROI) were measured using the change in fluorescence intensity (âˆ†F/F) and were analyzed using a unique stimulus index (USI) that compared the response to expected and unexpected stimuli. The study found that many neurons in both layers 2/3 and 5 showed large differences between their response to expected and unexpected events. Interestingly, these responses evolved in opposite directions in the somata and distal apical dendrites. The paper proposes a broad conceptual model in which the brain learns an internal representation of the world in associative regions, based on which top-down predictions are provided via the distal apical dendrites to pyramidal neurons in areas like VisP. If incoming stimuli contain unexpected features, i.e., features not predicted at the distal apical dendrites, pyramidal cell somatic and distal apical dendritic activity will reflect the unexpected feature or event. However, with experience, this activity triggers changes to the internal model of the world, such that it better captures the new information provided by the unexpected stimuli. As a result, the distal apical dendritic activity becomes more attuned to these novel forms of stimuli. The paper also discusses the limitations of the study, including the fact that somata and distal apical dendrites were not recorded in the same neurons, and the need for an ideal experiment to record simultaneously from other higher-order brain regions and their projections into visual cortex.
