The paragraph describes a scientific paper titled "Learning from unexpected events in the neocortical microcircuit" which explores the hypothesis that the neocortex learns a hierarchical predictive model of the world. The paper provides evidence that both somata and distal apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit distinct unexpected event signals that systematically change over days. The study was conducted by tracking the responses of individual somata and dendritic branches of layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons over multiple days in the primary visual cortex of an awake, behaving mouse using two-photon calcium imaging. Many neurons in both layers 2/3 and 5 showed large differences between their responses to expected and unexpected events. Interestingly, these responses evolved in opposite directions in the somata and distal apical dendrites. The paper proposes a broad conceptual model of unsupervised learning in the brain, which involves the formation of internal representations of the world in associative regions based on top-down predictions provided via the distal apical dendrites to pyramidal neurons in areas like VisP. If incoming stimuli contain unexpected features, i.e., features not predicted at the distal apical dendrites, pyramidal cell somatic and distal apical dendritic activity will reflect the unexpected feature or event. However, with experience, this activity triggers changes to the internal model of the world, such that it better captures the new information provided by the unexpected stimuli. The paper provides evidence in support of three observable signature features of unsupervised learning: (1) neurons respond differently to expected versus unexpected stimuli, (2) neural responses to unexpected stimuli changed over days, and (3) the evolution of these responses differed between the distal apical dendrites and the cell bodies. The authors propose that the differences between the somata and distal apical dendrites may be important for hierarchical computation, given that these two compartments tend to receive bottom-up and top-down information, respectively. The paper concludes that the visual cortex learns from unexpected events using a hierarchical model. The methods used in the study included fluorescence trace analysis, unexpected event selectivity indices, linear logistic regressions, and permutation tests, among others. The study aimed to decode the neural activity in mouse visual cortex in response to naturalistic stimuli and to understand the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception.
