This article discusses a study that aimed to understand how standardized behavioral events, such as fidgeting, impact the activity of primary sensory areas in the visual cortex of mice. The study developed a computer vision model to identify fidgeting behaviors accurately and found that these behaviors had a homogenous impact on neuronal responses across different cortical layers and areas. While fidgeting did not modulate visual responses, it could be a crucial component in how the cortex selects, learns, and binds local sensory information with motor outputs. The study provides foundational knowledge for modeling cortical computation and proposes a complementary approach to uncovering the role of motor signals in primary sensory areas. The article includes detailed methodology on the transgenic mice used in the study and the analysis of neuronal responses using two-photon calcium imaging. The study concludes that a standardized behavior has an equal impact on the cortex, and the article emphasizes the importance of including specific criteria in studies to ensure accurate reporting of functional properties in the mouse visual cortex.
