The paper titled "A standardized behavior equally impacts cortex" investigates the impact of motor activity on primary sensory areas, specifically the visual cortex, and the role of motor-related activity in sensory processing. The authors use a standardized and spontaneous behavioral fidget event in passively viewing mice to understand how these behavior signals are broadcast to different layers and areas of the visual cortex. They use a large two-photon Ca2+ imaging database of neuronal responses to uncover four neural response types during fidgets that were consistent in their proportion and response patterns across all visual areas and layers of the visual cortex. The authors suggest that the broad availability of visually orthogonal standardized behavior signals could be a key component in how the cortex selects, learns, and binds local sensory information with motor outputs. The paper also discusses the challenges of monitoring all potential behavior events and characterizing all associated neuronal correlates, as motor outputs are highly variable from trial to trial and hard to standardize and control. The authors developed a computer vision model to automatically identify fidget events from hours of mice behavioral videos and established a robust model that was as accurate at identifying fidgets and other mouse behaviors as human annotators. The study found that a standardized behavior equally impacts the cortex and that neuronal fidget responses do not modulate visually evoked activity. The study provides detailed information on the methods used, including animal head-implants and cortical window implantation. The paragraph describes the statistical analysis and methodology used in the study, as well as information about the study's funding, data availability, and acknowledgments. Overall, the study provides insights into the impact of standardized behavior on the cortex and the role of neuronal fidget responses in modulating visually evoked activity.
