The publication discusses the impact of standardized behavior on the cortex, specifically in relation to motor activity and sensory processing. The authors conducted a study using transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6f to investigate the impact of a standardized and spontaneous behavioral fidget event on the visual cortex. The authors used a large two-photon Ca2+ imaging database of neuronal responses to uncover four neural response types during fidgets that were consistent in their proportion and response patterns across all visual areas and layers of the visual cortex. The layer and area identity could not be decoded above chance level based only on neuronal recordings. The authors also sought to characterize the range of behavioral events that mice displayed under head fixation, observing a variety of behaviors such as whisking, grooming, mastication, flailing, walking, running, and a startle behavior denoted as a "fidget." The authors trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in a supervised manner using human-annotated labels to detect fidgets automatically. The authors found that the occurrence of fidgets could relate to visual stimuli, as the average normalized fidget rate was significantly higher during drifting gratings than other stimuli. The authors concluded that a standardized behavior equally impacts the cortex and that fidgeting does not affect visual responses. The publication also describes the stimuli and experimental setup used to measure the direction tuning, orientation tuning, and temporal frequency tuning of cells in the visual cortex of mice. The visual stimuli were generated using custom scripts written in PsychoPy and included drifting gratings, static gratings, locally sparse noise, natural scenes, and natural movies. During calcium imaging experiments, eye movements and animal posture were recorded. The left side of each mouse was imaged with the stimulation screen in the background to provide a detailed record of the animal response to all stimuli. The eye facing the stimulus monitor (right eye) was recorded using a custom IR imaging system. Two-photon movies (512x512 pixels, 30Hz), eyetracking (30Hz), and a side-view full-body camera (30Hz) were recorded and continuously monitored. For each two-photon imaging session, the image processing pipeline performed spatial or temporal calibration, motion correction, image normalization to minimize confounding random variations between sessions, segmentation of connected shapes, and classification of soma-like shapes from remaining clutter. Fluorescence movies were processed using a segmentation algorithm to identify somatic regions of interest (ROIs) that were described previously. Statistical tests were performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate framework (q<0.05), and all statistical tests in the study were two-tailed, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.
